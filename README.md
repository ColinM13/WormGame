# WormGame
University of Helsinki Java MOOC final project

I did not write any of the tests, the base file structure, or most of the gui.UserInterface and Main classes.
I am responsible for the domain, game, and everything else in the gui package besides what is noted in UserInterface.

Everything is included in repo for it to run.
